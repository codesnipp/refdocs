Getting Started

Dojo Toolkit is an open source modular JavaScript library designed to ease the rapid development of cross-platform, JavaScript/Ajax-based applications and web sites. It is divided into three areas, Dojo, Dijit and Dojox.

**Dojo** module provides the basic functionality to manage DOM, arrays, events, asynchronous requests and CSS etc. It provides core features that both Dijit (UI widgets) and DojoX (experimental code) rely on. It consists of  dojo.js, dojo/_base, Dojo Core.

**Dijit** is Dojoâ€™s UI Library, which contains well tested and ready to use UI widgets. It lives as a separate namespace dijit. Dijit is a widget system layered on top of Dojo. It can be used in one of two ways: declaratively by using special attributes inside of regular HTML tags, and programmatically through JavaScript.

**DojoX** provides advanced functionalities and widgets. It is an area for development of extensions to the Dojo toolkit. It  acts as a repository for experimental mature extensions.
